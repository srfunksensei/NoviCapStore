# Shopping Cart 

The cart example represents a shopping cart in an online store. The client can add an item to the cart, remove an item, or retrieve the cartâ€™s contents. 

The products are constantly changing by adding, removing, and repricing, so they are configurable with a json file (`products.json`). 

The checkout process allows for items to be scanned in any order, and should return the total amount to be paid. Total cost of a cart can be discounted by applying the following discounts:
* 2-for-1 promotions (buy two of the same product, get one free)
* bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced)
